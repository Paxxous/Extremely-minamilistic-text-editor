# Extremely minimalistic text editor

One of my first node js apps, and honestly, it's been pretty fun making this.

# Shortcuts

1. **ctrl + q**
    * Exits the program

1. **ctrl + s**
    * Saves your file

1. **ctrl + d**
    * Advanced saves your file, (Basically rename the file)
    * Leave blank and press save to cancel

1. **ctrl + g**
    * Swaps to dark mode because your eyes are too weak

# Announcments:

YAY!!! First version of beta is out :DD Supports both linux and windows.
